you'd need to install psutil by doing something like "python -m pip install psutil".
possibly "sudo apt install python3-psutil"

This thing is me trying to get used to VSCode. It could be used as a way to stop an app being run
until someone connects remotely to it. If it doesn't see the connection, it pauses the process.
